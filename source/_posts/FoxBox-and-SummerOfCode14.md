The goal of <span class="ZmSearchResult" id="DWT1138">foxbox</span> is to try any approach that make new user can do as less as possible to start the FirefoxOS development

Our first take is use [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) with [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to make major platform users can try FirefoxOS dev in VM.

It will be great to setup the current version of <span class="ZmSearchResult" id="DWT1140">foxbox</span> in your desktop environment

And record obstacles you encountered here <span class="Object" id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1144_com_zimbra_url">[https://github.com/gasolin/foxbox/issues?state=open](https://github.com/gasolin/foxbox/issues?state=open)</span>. 
There are some issues (but not the limit) that might be worth to do in the future version of <span class="ZmSearchResult" id="DWT1143">foxbox</span>.

Note that you require a desktop with INTEL VT-x/AMD-V hardware virtualization support(Windows8 or Mac already enabled it), at least 4GB RAM and about 10~40GB disk space(for gaia or full B2G development).

FoxBox has been approved by the Google Summer of Code administrator [http://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode14](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode14) , so its perfect time to step up, try FoxBox, fix issues that every others will encounter, save everybody's time and start make your own Firefox OS phone.
