An article "[The JavaScript Library World Cup](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/javascript-library)" in sitepoint compare four mainstream javascript libraries : Dojo, Prototype and Scriptaculous, Mochikit, and Yahoo! UI.

There's also an article [Ajax/DHTML Library Scorecard: How Cross Platform Are They?](http://www.musingsfrommars.org/2006/03/ajax-dhtml-library-scorecard.html) which compare the Cross Platform capability of JavaScript Libraries.

FYI, [TurboGears ](http://www.turbogears.org)has Mochikit buildin,
Prototype and Scriptaculous widgets available in [cogbin](http://www.turbogears.org/cogbin/),
and Yahoo! UI widgets in [sourceforge tgwidgets project repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tgwidgets).
